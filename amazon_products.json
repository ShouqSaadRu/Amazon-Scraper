            "comment": "The media could not be loaded.I'm 65, 5'5\" (shrinking), 191 (increasing), XL (because I like clothes to be roomy).  I ordered this in a L because some of the reviews seem to indicate that the dress fit large.  I'm here to say I don't agree.  This fit true to size.  A large fits me as a large should and that's why I don't particularly care for it and will send it back for an XL.  I feel it is a bit too fitted in the belly (fat) area and behind as well as at the shoulder and under the arms.  If I feel it, I don't like it.  The material is soft and light, pockets on either hip are deep but without sticking out on the hip, and the pattern is a soft green and pink with white.  The pattern is unique from all the 10 same faabric choices coming out of China right now.  The hem has a flirty little spin to it when twisting the hips and the V neckline is not deep or exposing of the cleavage.  The length is just above the knee, a nice modest length so as not to rise too high when seated.  All in all it is a great summer dress for most jobs, the beach, restaurants, shows, etc.  I do think if the sun is shining behind it undergarments will be outlined so I would put the visibility factor at around 4 out of 10.  Somewhat modest but maybe a camisole or half slip if you really want to be completely covered.  In fluorescent light I believe there would be no concern of visibility.  The price is right and the design options are varied.Read more",

It did shrink about an inch after washing and drying (tag says not to use dryer) which I was hoping it would. At 5\u20191\u201d it now hits right above my knee. I wish it were one inch shorter, but it still looks and fits great. So far it\u2019s been washed and dried about half a dozen times and it still looks great.Read more",

It's the kind of dress you could wear all day without wanting to change. Plus\u2014it has pockets! That alone makes it a winner in my book.The only downside is that the black portion of the dress faded a bit after the first wash. Thankfully, the blue color held up really well, which makes me think it may just be the black dye that\u2019s less stable. I'm considering buying this in other colors because overall, it's such a great piece\u2014versatile, cozy, and stylish.Just a heads-up: I\u2019d recommend washing it on cold and maybe line drying to preserve the color better. Otherwise, it\u2019s a wardrobe staple!Read more",

It fits well, is well made well with thick material that is not see through in the top or bottom. The skirt portion is lined and heavier so it hangs very nicely and flows when I walk. It hits just at my ankles for length. It's now a summer essential for me! For reference I'm 5' 6\", 130lbs with a D cup and I'm wearing a small.The only thing I would mention about it is that it does wrinkle easily. When it arrived in its original packaging I gave it a good steam which took out all of the wrinkles. If you plan to travel with this dress in a suitcase, plan to hang it when you arrive or give it another steam before you wear it.Very happy with this dress!Read more",

Pair it with a cute tote and flats and it's perfect outfit to run errands around town.Comfortable, cooling fabric that has some weight to it, so it flows nicely. Flattering cut. Pockets are nice and deep, so they are functional. Although the dress does not have lining, the reverse side of the fabric feels like lining, smooth and comfy. I'm more of an apple shape and this dress is super flattering. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. I ordered two more. I wish they had more color options though, like bright colors for the summer.I did go a size up only because I like a little more flow for the summer weather.Read more",

The arm holes are also made well, with a panel of fabric to hide your bra.  The slits on the sides do not come above my knee which I appreciate.  This is a great easy everyday dress that you can wear with sneakers and a denim jacket or dress up with sandals and jewelry.  It\u2019s become my new travel dress and I intend to buy more colors.  Very well made and worth the price!Read more",

The waist has elastic, so it gives a comfortable but flattering shape. I styled it with sneakers and a crochet shrug for a casual day out, and got several compliments.If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight, easy-to-wear dress that looks cute and feels great, I highly recommend this one.

The fabric is of a good quality and not see through, and it\u2019s true to size but stretchy so if you are sort of in between a S/M or M/L etc, you can size down.The only thing is the straps are adjustible with buttons, and one of hers came off when she tried the dress on. It was no big deal, we just sewed the button back on and reinforced the other button too. So you might want to sew the buttons on more securely (there are only 2, 1 per strap).It\u2019s a beautiful dress, my daughter wears it with dressy sandals, casual flip flops, and white sneakers and it all looks cute.Read more",

I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d 152-155 lbs, 38/40D and I ordered a Medium, and while it was comfortable, I felt it was a little too boxy!  I ordered a small in the green and I LOVE it.  It has quite a bit of stretch and the fit is fabulous!  I exchanged the Medium for the small in this beige print!  I love how flowy and cool it is, and the fact that you can adjust the straps and can prob get away without wearing a bra!  Something I\u2019d normally never consider, given my size.  I never have any luck dress shopping in the stores, but wow, this one wins the prize!Read more",

This one fits me best in XL even in the white pair I bought\u2026some of you know exactly what I mean!  But the workout shorts with the built in liner, the XL are too tight in the thigh and unflattering. So when I bought the board short/swimming short I bought both sizes knowing I\u2019d have to return one. Depending on the color it could go either way. Rose XXL, blue XL\u2026.go figure. Still love them once I get the size right.Read more",

The high waistband is great - holds everything in without being uncomfortable, rolling, or digging in.You can easily dress these up or down, and I\u2019d have no problem wearing them to work.

I was a little nervous to order this dress at first because I thought the print was a little on the Grandma side, however actually seeing it on me completely changed my mind; its gorgeous. I have a few dresses like this that I ordered on Amazon by a few different sellers and this one is by far my favorite. Between the fit and the fabric, it is incredibly comfortable. I usually wear a 14 so thats the size I went with. I am only 5'1 and 192lbs with a DD chest (I'm also 17 weeks pregnant) and it fits like a glove. Also, the neckline is perfect. Most of the dresses I have like this. The neckline is higher. This one is a little lower which makes it more comfortable to me. It is a little long on me because I'm so short, but if I was even just an inch or two taller and it would be perfect. If you are on the fence about this dress - ORDER IT. You won't regret it.Read more",

I am used to sizing up to get additional length. This dress did not measure the  52.2\" in length per the size chart. The chart does note there may be up to an inch variance. The dress I received was 49.5\" long. I am a 36B cup and fill out the top of the dress which makes me think the missing length is in the torso because the skirts are probably all the same length regardless of size. The elastic waist is very generous, so getting the dress on and off is very easy. The fabric dye is consistent on the light blue and the stitching is clean. The lining makes the dress look cheap but not a deal breaker. Bottom line, if you are looking for a maxi dress fit and are 5'8\" or above, this may not be the dress for you.Read more",

I wish it was a little more fitted. I have to pull it down a bit so it doesn't \"poof\" out around my chest. But overall, it's a great, comfortable dress. Just be careful because it does \"snag\" on things. First day I wore it at church, part of a chair snagged it because it got caught on one of the eyelet holes and made a little rip. Still like it though. It's very bright and I love it! I did order a pink shirt to wear underneath so you couldn't see through the sleeves. Nobody even noticed.Read more",

I love these dresses so much, I actually bought another one yesterday that is black with orange and pink flowers. I\u2019m so excited for it to come in the mail!I absolutely love the fit and feel of the fabric. The fit is super flattering. Even though it has a lot of room for comfort, it doesn\u2019t look baggy and hits all the right curves in all the right places.The fabric is soft with a cool touch to it. It\u2019s thin, but durable. I\u2019ve had the black one for two years now and it\u2019s still going strong. I\u2019ve probably worn and washed it 30 plus times. It\u2019s my go to outfit when I\u2019m going out.Read more",

There is quite a bit of stretch in the waist. I\u2019m wearing average dress boots with the slightest heel in these pictures and was not worried about tripping over the dress, but I think I would need to be careful if I wore sandals or was walking barefoot.The dress comes vacuumed sealed and I tried this on right away so that\u2019s why the dress might look a little wrinkly.What I love: I love the colors and the print on this dress. I really like this style and there\u2019s so many colors to match with it. The dress is lightweight and comfortable. I love the loose sleeves, the neckline, and the button at the back of the neck. It\u2019s giving prairie / hippie fem. And it has pockets!!What I don\u2019t love: I bought this dress when it was on sale and even that was quite a bit higher than I normally spend on one garment. When I opened it and saw how many loose threads it had all over the hem of the dress and the sleeves, I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would pay *full* price for it! This dress is not a high enough quality for the sales price I paid, nevermind full price! The dress also has conflicting washing instructions on the tag and on the label.I\u2019m keeping the dress because I really like the pattern and the fit, but I won\u2019t be buying from this company again now that I know they charge high prices for low quality items.Read more",

I am 5\u20194\u201d and weigh 140 lbs. I have a large bust and it was nice and roomy in the chest area and slim fitting in the waist and hip areas. The length was long on me, which I am ok with.

So needless to say this dress did not work for me.Good: The size was right, width wise and the length was to the floor - fine. The fabric was nice, thick and silky and the print and colors were very nice (outdoor garden wedding MOB).Not so good: It came in a very large box with lots of room, yet it was all bunched up in a little plastic bag which made the dress very wrinkled. The wrinkles came out after 24 hrs on a hanger. The neckline is very curious. It would not hang right. I think it was stitched a little off which  caused an odd drape. There are buttons behind the neck which I had difficulty with, even with the dress off. No way could I button up with the dress on and I dont think my husband could do it either. The loops for the buttons were tiny, tiny. If you have an apple shaped body, this dress would make you look just like that - an apple. But you probably already know that. What was I thinking!I do think this dress has lots of potential for other bodies.Read more",

I was a tad reluctant because I\u2019m not a ruffle dress kinda gal but it\u2019s very subtle in black and a very flattering dress on my size1X 63-yo body. The XXL fits me well with some room to spare and the slip underneath is much longer than what the photo would have you believe, which I\u2019m thankful for the length as my legs swell ridiculously when I fly and this dress will cover that for me. I will wear this for other occasions as well, dinners out, etc. Just a very pretty dress that you\u2019ll appreciate! Seams are sturdy, the fabric is nice, the belt is a good length. It\u2019s a bit of an empire waist as opposed to my true waist but it looks fantastic regardless. It comes with an extra snap set if you need it. The existing snap at the cleavage is just right for me but you could sew on the other if you want more coverage if you\u2019re very busty.Read more",

The dress looks like an empire waist on me, which was unexpected but lovely.  I was surprised when I sat down - the snap popped open! So it's a perfect fit when standing but the snap is at an odd location - something I don't mind fixing myself.On an odd note- my dress was clearly worn and not washed. It stunk SO BADLY of BO! If I didn't need this dress immediately, I'd have returned it. Amazon- do better at inspecting returned garments. This should have had a small discount to account for the problems just like hard goods do.Read more",

Elastic waist and can wear with or without provided fabric belt as there are no belt loops so belt does move around but no big deal. Could also use a different belt.

My under slip on the dress is longer than shown in the photo, which I appreciate the longer length.  I had no idea I could get such good quality at this price point.  When I ordered this early Sunday morning, the system indicated same day delivery (which is why I ordered it).  After placing the order, the system said I could not get it until the next morning.  I was stressing because I ordered it to wear the next day, Monday, at an 11am funeral.  I work in healthcare and tend to compartmentalize and do things as needed.  I got really lucky because the dress came at 8:45am.  I doubt Amazon will see this but it\u2019s no good if your system tells me I can get something same day and then after submitting the order I\u2019m told next day.  I got lucky today but was definitely sweating it.Read more",

Once you steam it it stays pretty smooth.  I feel great in it and it fits loose enough and not tight to the body.

Other than that, it's the perfect casual summer dress, and I received numerous compliments on the color.Read more",

Bought one and threw it on after some sprays of Downey wrinkle release for the vacuum sealed wrinkles and was out the door in 5 minutes.Wore it for a hour and then literally ordered 6 more in different colors for about $100! So cheap, but doesn\u2019t look it. And because I live in SoCal, I can wear it year round by layering.No lining and no pockets, but that\u2019s better for the weather here anyway. And the material just slinks over your body, thick enough to not show any lumps and bumps, but thin enough to not be hot.The top fits correctly, and the darting allows it to hug the girls without leaving gaping holes in the armpit. The waist was loose enough to move comfortably, but fitted enough to not look like a sack. The bottom was a loose enough to not show any VPL, but not a swing or trapeze shape.It\u2019s the perfect length on me. I\u2019m so short that most \u201cshort\u201d dresses go past my knee, but this one is right above it. When you sit, it will ride up, and the slit on the side will go higher, so it may be more of a tunic length for you taller ladies, but won\u2019t be indecent if you wear bike shorts under them just in case the slit rides too high.For summer, I threw on some sandals. For work, I can throw some heels on for big presentations, or wear sneakers for running around and still look professional while being comfortable and still able to get down on the ground, if needed.Most of the colors are discounted right now, so my fellow professional shorties- scoop them up now before they realize what they have!Read more",

I could have done a medium but the small is not skin tight, just fitted.  I am wider around the hips (about 40\u2019) so the small is quite generous. I was worried about the fabric being too thin and especially in a lighter color showing all my lumps and bumps, particularly in the rear area but the fabric is thick enough to conceal flaws but not too thick to be too warm in hot summer temps. As other reviewers have noted, the slit may not be office friendly as the dress is short but it\u2019s perfect for casual wear.  I have not washed or worn this dress yet so I may update as I\u2019m worried about the fabric pilling.Read more",

Simple to dress up with a couple of bracelets and a necklace- nude sandals... It felt fabulous. I would buy it in every color LOL! I am a little busty and most dresses that fit that area are huge and hang- but this one fit perfectly and flattered my figure. I wish I had a picture!! It was the best buy for me of all the clothes I bought this past year. I liked that it DID not have pockets as that makes the dress wide at the hips. Super comfortable and just beautiful in black.Read more",

The top is super stretchy and would probably fit quite a range of bust sizes. The dress flows beautifully and makes me want to twirl around with my hands in my pockets! I wore it to church on a hot summer day with cute strappy sandals, but could easily be worn casually with some cute sneakers. It did take some time to iron after hanging to dry, so it\u2019s definitely not wrinkle resistant. But totally worth it! Received tons of compliments in this dress!I\u2019m 5\u2019 tall and it brushes my ankles. Perfect maxi length for me but would probably be more mid-calf for taller ladies. I bought this in 3 colors!Read more",

It holds its shape well and has a nice flow to it. The stitching is clean and the fit was mostly true to size. That said, the design could use a little refinement\u2014maybe a more defined waist or adjustable straps to elevate the overall silhouette.

I liked that the ruffles on the straps covered up my armpit area and that the dress overall was very forgiving! It also was a really great length and hit me a little higher than my ankles. The material isn\u2019t see through at all and is light and breathable! It does get a little wrinkled after washing but a steamer gets them right out. The way it\u2019s made makes the wrinkles not very noticeable though! I am unsure if drying it in their dryer changes the fit as I only have air dried mine so far.Read more",

It is the kind of scrunch material up top but it stretches to fit around any bust. The length of it is good and it\u2019s a very neutral color. I only had to wash it out of the package in order to get the wrinkles out, no ironing. So simple and can be styled different times of the year. I wore mine to our gender reveal party with a jean jacket & it was so cute a friend asked to borrow it afterwards.Read more",

It\u2019s beautiful. Straps totally cover bra straps. It\u2019s a little big on me. I\u2019m a size 18, 5 feet 5.5 inches tall for reference.Dress #2: I ordered a week after dress #1. I ordered a size XL in color black. This dress did arrive sooner than expected via UPS. Sadly, this dress is totally opposite Dress #1. First, as others have stated, the color is not black, but in fact a dark navy blue. Also, the material is also not the same. It\u2019s polyester type, feels very cheap, very thin.Although I liked the sizing, I absolutely hated everything else. The color was off, fabric is different, weight of fabric is different, so it\u2019s sheer, the straps are not as wide, and it doesn\u2019t lay on the body as nicely as Dress #1.Dress #1 is of great quality and looks more expensive than a $30 dress. Dress #2 on the other hand is over priced at $30 and is being returned.Read more",

I love these dresses so much, I actually bought another one yesterday that is black with orange and pink flowers. I\u2019m so excited for it to come in the mail!I absolutely love the fit and feel of the fabric. The fit is super flattering. Even though it has a lot of room for comfort, it doesn\u2019t look baggy and hits all the right curves in all the right places.The fabric is soft with a cool touch to it. It\u2019s thin, but durable. I\u2019ve had the black one for two years now and it\u2019s still going strong. I\u2019ve probably worn and washed it 30 plus times. It\u2019s my go to outfit when I\u2019m going out.Read more",

There is quite a bit of stretch in the waist. I\u2019m wearing average dress boots with the slightest heel in these pictures and was not worried about tripping over the dress, but I think I would need to be careful if I wore sandals or was walking barefoot.The dress comes vacuumed sealed and I tried this on right away so that\u2019s why the dress might look a little wrinkly.What I love: I love the colors and the print on this dress. I really like this style and there\u2019s so many colors to match with it. The dress is lightweight and comfortable. I love the loose sleeves, the neckline, and the button at the back of the neck. It\u2019s giving prairie / hippie fem. And it has pockets!!What I don\u2019t love: I bought this dress when it was on sale and even that was quite a bit higher than I normally spend on one garment. When I opened it and saw how many loose threads it had all over the hem of the dress and the sleeves, I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would pay *full* price for it! This dress is not a high enough quality for the sales price I paid, nevermind full price! The dress also has conflicting washing instructions on the tag and on the label.I\u2019m keeping the dress because I really like the pattern and the fit, but I won\u2019t be buying from this company again now that I know they charge high prices for low quality items.Read more",

The material seems easy to care for, it\u2019s a smooth 60% polyester 35% rayon 5% elastane blend so it has a slight stretch to it and is wrinkle free. That makes it perfect for vacations! It is just the right thickness and I don\u2019t feel I need to wear a slip or worry about VPL.Here come the cons.The flutter sleeves hit right where the arms are widest. Usually flutter sleeves are great for women with thicker arms but a little more length would have helped in this case. I felt a little conscious about my arms.Moreover, the v-neck is not as deep as the images portray. This is a consistent problem seen in other product images. I thought I could overcome it with my needle and thread. (And another reviewer said they did this.)However, I looked at the seam and although the front could easily be unpicked to give a more flattering (yet still modest) inch or two, the reverse had a flat piece of cloth which would require cutting and edging. And that\u2019s just too much work for me. Please look at the pictures for reference. The higher v-neckline makes the chest area look broader and makes my shoulders look wider.I am 5\u20195\u201d, 38C, 180lb, ordered the M, and the dress hit below the knees.The medium fits well, but it made me look like I\u2019m in my first trimester(!), and for that reason, I\u2019m returning it.Read more",

I\u2019ve already washed it thinking the material would soften up, but had zero luck. The black one is a cute dress, but is made with extremely uncomfortable material making it unwearable. I feel like I\u2019ve wasted money on it since it\u2019s already been washed & I cannot return it. Totally bummed about that.Read more",

The fabric is soft and lightweight, and I love the pockets (always a win!). I've worn it for everything from running errands to casual get-togethers, and it is super easy to dress up or down.My only complaint-and why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5- is that the black color has noticeably faded after just a few washes, even on the gentle cycle and hang drying. It still looks great just not a crisp and dark as when it first arrived. If color longevity is important to you keep that in mind.Read more",

I am an experienced seamstress who does major alterations so I ordered a large instead of a medium/small based on the reviews.1) the color is not the same as shown on the screen. Definitely not teal, nor sky blue as described. More of a light turquoise which will match with several shirts I currently own.2) the large is long enough for me to wear with the straps down (5\u20197\u201d 130 pounds and flat chested) however, the crotch falls midway between my privates and my knees. This is definitely roomy in the hips and thighs making it comfortable to wear this summer at the beach.3) The tag says it is 100% cotton. It feels more like a soft bamboo rayon and I will wash the smell and wrinkles out using cold water as instructed and update.4) I will be altering by taking in the sides probably 1-2\u201d each. This will still be roomy enough to get on.  The thing I really like was the placement of the pockets. They are both on the side seam but inset with a placket. Deep and roomy for my cell phone in one and glasses in the other. The seams of the pockets were left raw. If this is truly 100% cotton this will fray and ruin the entire garment. (I will fix them before I laundered but for non sewers I highly recommend getting some \u201cfray check\u201dor using clear fingernail polish to secure them prior to washing)5) Final thoughts: these are cute, and have a palazzo width leg with a small slit at the ankle. Beware that they do not become capris as it will definitely affect the body image by cutting you off!Read more",

The elastic on the sides works magic and makes the romper look fitted and not boxy.\u00a0 I purchased the white floral (it was on sale) and am surprised how much it goes with everything.\u00a0 This is cute with just about any tank top from racerback to spaghetti strap.\u00a0 It has been great to throw on over a bathing suit!Buy it!Read more",

The pockets are big enough to hold your phone and keys. The fabric is thin and not the best, but I still like it and would purchase another one. I like that on the sides under your arms, it has a little elastic in the lining. I am disappointed in the length of the legs; the ones I got do not come all the way down to the floor; they're more capri in length. While I'm sure someone could dress this up, I am too casual and laid back. I wear a t-shirt or tank top under it and call it a day. Overall, I'm pleased with this, and I would buy another one.Read more",

Personally, I felt like it made my hips look a lot bigger than they actually are because of where the seam sits. You\u2019d think it has pockets from looking at it but it does not. There is also a zipper which I didn\u2019t know, it kept making a weird \u201clip\u201d in the side that poked out right under my armpit. The back is a lot longer than expected as well, like unusually long but it is still super cute & worked for the wedding I went to!Read more",

I didn't even need to use the zipper to get it on or off. The seams line up a little oddly against my body's natural proportions. (Perhaps I could have gone down a size to a 1X?) The sleeves fit well, not too snug but secure. The front hem came down juuust below my knees and the back hem just below my calves. The fabric itself felt soft and smooth. It also had a 'quality weight' feeling to it and was not 'thin looking' when held up against the light. (The deeper color may have helped with this.) There were a few loose threads that didn't simply 'pull away' and will need trimmed or affixed. The royal blue color was a little darker than I expected - less 'Bright Blue' as shown and a little more 'Bright Navy'.Read more",

However, I ordered a small, but I think an XS would have been ideal. On me, it runs a bit big but I do have a small frame. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this dress. It is absolutely stunning!  The workmanship and the material is high quality!  Everyone needs a dress like this one!  It arrived within two days of ordering!  Overall, I give this dress and the company that sold it 10 stars \u2b50\ufe0f out of 5! Thank you so much!  I am very happy! I am planning to buy again!  All I can say is that it is STUNNING' I wore it once and was continuously complemented on my dress. People asked me if it was a Channel dress? As I said, the quality is outstanding.  I was extremely surprised given the fact that it was under $40. And beautifully sewn and sits on the body just perfectly.  Thank you so much once again!  VictoriaRead more",

However, the seller was really nice, they provided a full refund to me and did not push me to provide a better review. I chose to give them a better review because of how they handled my return.This dress is not cotton (not even the 60% as the ad claims). It is 100% polyester/spandex mix. The dress comes with a ruched band at the top which is not flattering. I would not recommend this product.Read more",

However, it wrinkled badly before I ever arrived at dinner, even though I tried to keep it spread out as I sat.  The material is also pretty see through. I was able to get away with not wearing a slip by wearing neutral colored undergarments, but I could see the outline of my legs.  I would not buy this dress again.

I'm concerned it will shrink when washed and the ruffles will look bad since it's not a quality, strong fabric. I'm on the larger side so I feel bigger in it based on the design/cut, but to run to the store and throw this on with a pair of flipflops or flats, it will be OK.  I bought it in several colors and the only one that I really liked on me was the pink, surprisingly; even the black didn't look right.

I still wore shapewear because after a gallbladder removal my scars are sorta indented and look weird in certain things. But I think this dress is super flattering for almost any body type. There is a grippy strip along the top of the dress so it stayed put and didn\u2019t fall all night. For reference I\u2019m 6ft tall and about 170. I wore the large, but this dress is so stretchy I could have gotten away with a medium. (I prefer it to be a bit roomy though) there is an identical dress that\u2019s a little shorter aso from this seller I wish I went with as I prefer the look just below the knee but either way this one was beautiful and almost full length give. How tall I am. It has a cute slit in the back to help with movement when walking but again, this dress is very stretchy. I bought this for my friends wedding and got green and blue to help me decide on color and ended up deciding to keep both. I\u2019ll probably wear the green to my company Christmas party if I don\u2019t buy a new red one. lol.  Also the straps are versatile. Can be worn off the shoulder or worn as a wide strap if you decide to pull it up over your shoulder.Love love love this dress. I don\u2019t think you can go wrong. Totally worth it.Read more",

This dress is made of a lightweight material that was perfect for a hot Texas day. The color was a true black and has remained just as vibrant even after washing! I purchased a Large, as I wanted a loose, flowy fit and it was perfect!  For reference I am size 8-10 so could have gone with a medium, but wanted the oversized fit for breathability and comfort. I will be purchasing this in other colors as it has now become a staple in in wardrobe!Read more",

The seam that should be below the bust hits me on the bust, just barely. I am 5\u20198\u201d ish with a 40c bust. The colors are vivid and true to the pictures. I washed it in warm and hung it to dry and it shrunk lengthwise just a bit. I also removed the tassels as they looked low quality to me. Even so, I\u2019m seriously considering buying another color. It\u2019s an easy and comfortable dress to wear.Read more",

The material is a bit thin, I felt like I needed to wear a slip. However, for summer it does make it cool. the fit seemed a bit weird when I first put it on, the top doesn't have a really defined area where the sleeves start so in certain positions, it seemed like it was a bit droopy around the chest area, like maybe I needed to be a bit larger there. But, it's very comfortable and I did get some compliments on it! It comes VERY wrinkled so plan on throwing it in the washer or dryer or doing some ironing. This dress does not have pockets. I did feel like it was a bit pricey for the thin fabric.Read more",

But what the other reviews neglect to mention is that the dress is not meant for anyone with a decent sized bossom. I am 5'3\" 118lbs and a B-C-cup. I bought a medium and I was unable to get the waist line of the dress over my chest. It even has an elastic band, so maybe that was meant to help, but it doesn't. If I didn't rip it putting it on, it was going to rip coming off. If you are thin amd small chested, go for it!Read more",

I'd say it fits true to size, BUT I really need an XS and the Small is as small as it comes.  It's a little big on me, especially in the bodice.  I think I \"feel\" it's too big more than it \"looks\" too big, so I think I'll keep it.Be sure to steam the wrinkles out for a polished look.Read more",

I did buy a decorative belt to go with. I get sooooo many compliments on the dress and asked where I got it. I found the dress true to size. I loved it so much that I bought it in another color, and it is very comfortable to wear to the office or out and about. There is a small snap on the bust line to keep it from opening up and showing too much.  And the bonus is that the dress has pockets!!!!!Read more",

However when I wore it the second time I noted a  thin area on the chest area where the muslin is so thin it is like a rip. Took the dress off and found another thin almost ripped area in the skirt. I tried to return it but my 30 day return window has gone by. I emailed Pretty garden and have not heard from them.  I am sad about this dress as I loved it and I am mad that I don\u2019t know how to return it now.  I bought the tan and black color. Perhaps the other colors use thicker material. I would give it a 5 star rating if the material wasn\u2019t so thin.Read more",

I\u2019m 5.1\u201d 138 lbs and ordered a size medium. I have a belly that makes me feel very self conscious because at times it makes me look pregnant if I don\u2019t wear something that favors my body type. The pregnant look (without being pregnant) is what I was trying to avoid. After trying the dress on, I think I could have gotten away with a small but the medium fit nice in all the right places. I didn\u2019t look pregnant and I felt so pretty and comfortable. I love that it has pockets and the material kept me cool on a very hot day. All in all a wonderful dress that I will  be reaching for time and time again.Read more",

I was a bit nervous buying clothes online for her (sizing can be tricky!), but I'm so glad I took the chance.First off, the quality is fantastic for the price. I was expecting something flimsy, but the fabric is soft, breathable and has a nice weight to it. My wife says its super comfortable, perfect for hot summer days.Second, the fit is surprisingly flattering. I went with her usual size, and it fit her like a dream. It skims her body in all the right places without being too tight. She loves the flowy skirt. Plus, according to her and I agree, the length is great \u2013 not too short, not too long.My wife looks absolutely gorgeous in this dress, and that makes me happy. If you're looking for a stylish, comfortable, and affordable summer dress for your wife (or yourself!), don't hesitate. I highly recommend this Women's Summer Dress. You can't go wrong!Read more",

The poofy bottom added interest to the dress. Everyone kept telling me my dress was cute. I\u2019m 5\u20195, 165 lbs, 40 inch bust, usually a 38C in bras, and I got a Large. I could\u2019ve gone with a Medium (I ordered it too) because the waist fit just right but could tell by end of night it would\u2019ve been too snug after eating so I went with the Large b/c I wanted to feel comfy and cute all night. Def had to use a steamer for bottom of dress but took literally 1 min to get rid of wrinkles and stayed wrinkle free all night!Read more",

The wrap design of the dress fits me beautifully and the skirt has a very generous amount of fabric, so it drapes on the body well. The fabric print is as pictured on the site. The fabric itself seems to resist wrinkles and is very cool to wear in the summer. I like the dress so well I have ordered  another in a different pattern. Great purchase for a small price!Read more",

The material is soft and smooth with some stretch, but it can be a bit see-through so you might want to wear a slip or bike shorts underneath I typically wear a four or six in dresses, but I bought this in a medium to make sure there was enough room in the best area because I\u2019m a 34 triple D. I have to say the fit is pretty perfect. I\u2019m 5 foot six and the dress hits just below my knees, which is a good length for me. The dress is super comfortable and flattering. The material quality is nice. The only thing I would change is I wish the fabric was a bit thicker or the dress had a lining. I bought the green leopard print and the blue floral and love both of the colors. I\u2019ve been wearing these with sandals and white tennis shoes and they make a nice look and are so easy to throw on and go.Read more",

I do love this dress but it was a little long on me at 5'5\" it skimmed the ground and I just don't like clothes to touch the dirty floor.  I am going to get the ruffle removed and hemmed if alterations don't cost more than I paid for the dress.  Just beware it is pretty long.Read more",

This dress is absolutely lovely and very flattering. The fabric is thick, heavy, and high-quality. It is not see-through, which I really appreciate.The only issue for petite women is the length. I have to wear it with a belt to lift it up a bit and create a better shape. It works, and it looks great with the belt, but I still hope to find a dress one day that fits me this well without needing any adjustments. For now, this one is a great option.Read more",

From the moment I put it on, I knew it was special. Not only did it fit like it was tailored by woodland fairies who specialize in waist-cinching magic, but it also made me look like I had an actual figure instead of my usual \"vaguely human-shaped laundry pile\" aesthetic.The waist? Perfection. It nips in just enough to make me look like I have an hourglass silhouette instead of a \"slightly squashed rectangle.\" The skirt? Absolute twirl supremacy. I spun around like a deranged ballerina in my living room, and not once did I fear a wardrobe malfunction\u2014this dress is modest but in a \"I\u2019m classy, not frumpy\" kind of way. No accidental sheerness, no awkward shortness, just pure, unadulterated twirlability.I wore it for Easter, and let me tell you, I didn\u2019t just attend brunch\u2014I floated into that room like a pink cloud of elegance. My relatives, who usually greet me with \"Oh, you look... tired,\" actually said, \"Wow, you look nice!\" (A Christmas miracle in April.) Even after three helpings of ham and approximately seven deviled eggs, the dress still fit like a dream. No unbuttoning in the bathroom, no desperate stretch-and-sigh. Just pure, uninterrupted comfort.If you\u2019re looking for a dress that makes you feel feminine, put-together, and secretly like the protagonist of a rom-com where you accidentally fall in love with a baker during a spring festival\u2014this is the one. Five stars, zero regrets, and 100% chance I\u2019ll be wearing this to every vaguely spring occasion until I die.Read more",

I bought a matching crocheted shrug to wear with it.  Also, I felt that it was still really sheer and see-through, even though there was a slip under the lace, but the slip was very thin and it also seemed to short, so I bought a matching slip to extend the coverage and reduce the sheerness of the material.  However, this dress is really beautiful!Read more",

The fit was true to size, accentuating my curves without being too tight. It was perfect for casual beach strolls and dinners out. Easy to pack, wrinkle-resistant, and super versatile\u2014this dress is a summer must-have! Highly recommend!Read more",
